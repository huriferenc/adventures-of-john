      John, the adventurer, is trying to save the world. To do this, he broke into the super-secret
      laboratory of the infamous Robocos de Evil to steal the plans for a world-destroying gadget.
      He was already on his way out to the meadow next to the building complex when the theft was
      discovered, and John was chased by countless robots from all directions to catch him. Help
      John get rid of the robots and escape with the plans. The world needs you!
    </p>
    <p>
      In each step, the player takes a step with John in one of the 4 directions, and after that
      each robot also takes a step towards the player in the shortest possible way. If two robots
      enter the same square, both are destroyed, leaving only a wreck in their place. If a robot
      steps on a wreck, it will still be destroyed and become a wreck. If John encounters a robot or
      wreck, he dies and the world is destroyed. You can't get off the track.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like all action heroes, John has a gadget that helps him out. With this, you can teleport to
      another place on the track. Teleporting counts as a step, i.e. the robots move towards the new
      location. The teleport will surely take you to a place where no robot can enter, but its
      battery only allows a few safe teleports, after which it does not guarantee the safety of the
      place.
    </p>
    <p>The player wins if he has destroyed all the robots chasing him.</p>
    <p>We count the steps taken during the game. This number starts from zero and</p>
    <ul>
      <li>John decreases by one every step he takes;</li>
      <li>increases by 20 per robot when a robot is destroyed;</li>
      <li>reduced by 100 when teleported.</li>
